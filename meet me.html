   <h3>PROGRAMMER</h3>

   <p> I am first a humanitarian,then an economist,
      <br> with an added advantage of being a programmer.
  <br>  Give me an opportunity and see me explore.
      <br> I am a strong-willed individual who beleives 
     <br>  that its a crime to bow to situations of life <br> or give up in the midst of challenges. <br> The End justifies the means is my favorite quote
       <p>My greatest dream in life is to be a great positive <br> impact to my society and as a programmer, <br> I can reach out to many
          <br> I beleive in being resourceful no matter the stae i am; <br> no matter the state of the society; <br> no matter the discouraging factors around. 
          <p><em> Life is about how many lifes you help find meaning.</em>
<br> I have great passion for creativity and growth,<br> diligence and positive attitude to work: <br> call me if you are honest
